	<ol><h2>Priority Queue</h2></ol>
	<li>characterized by the remove the maximum and insert operations</li>
	<br>
	<li>Bottom-up reheapify (swim): If the heap order is violated because a node's key becomes larger than that node's parents key, fix by exchanging the node with its parent.</li>

	<li>Top-down heapify (sink):  a node's key becomes smaller than one or both of that node's children's keys, fix by exchanging the node with the larger of its two children</li>

	<li>Insert: add key to bottom (end of array) and swim up</li>
	<li>Remove max: exchange bottom children (end of array) with root, remove new bottom children (max), sink new root down</li>

	<ol><h2>Heapsort</h2></ol>
	<li>insert all the keys to be sorted into a minimum-oriented priority queue, then repeatedly use remove the minimum to remove them all in order</li>
